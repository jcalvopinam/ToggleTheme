# ToggleTheme

This application switches between the Light and Dark mode in Mojave in the simplest way.

  - It does not consume resources.
  - It does not run in the background.
  - Changes the current theme when you want.
  - This is magical, just launch the application and voila!
  - Enjoy it!

*The idea of ToggleTheme was born as the need to quickly change between Mojave’s Light and Dark mode, I wanted something faster and easier to use, so I developed this application, I think other users could have the same need, so I share it with you, it's available to download.*
